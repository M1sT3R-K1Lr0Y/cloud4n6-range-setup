# cloud4n6-range-setup

### Background

I currently work as a full-time security engineer for a financial services provider.  I also have been teaching Cloud Forensics since October 2017 where I taught my first class at the Security B-Sides conference in Washington, DC.  Since then, the class I teach has gone through several revisions - including a full re-write on the advice of a hacker crew from Spain - and is now what it is today.  How does artificial intelligence play a role in the forensics process?  Automation?  Machine learning?  IoT?  How does it all integrate with the Cloud?

It was these questions (and so much more) which led me to creating this repo.  Granted, I needed a quick way to generate the CloudFormation templates for my AWS environment in order to hasten the buildout of my cyber range I use for both testing and my CTFs.  I'll be the first to admit that GPT may not *always* get it right, but with a few tweaks here and there, WYSIWYG.

### Caveats and Permissions

WYSIWYG.  Also, a huge thank-you to the crew at Cado Security; to my fellow instructors MalwareBrad, Marcelle Lee, and C_3PJoe; and to my colleagues joeklein, th3cyF0x, Quadling, and Tyler for their valuable input and feedback on this whole project from the beginning.  Also to anyone else I missed - charge it to my head and not to my heart.

Others are welcome to create forks from this repository on the condition they cite their resources properly.  Ergo, place it in the bloody script somewhere where it's easy to spot.  Also, any changes to the main repo must be approved by Yours Truly before I merge them into this branch.  Now, on to the show.

### What's here

Yes, I'm a lazy bum and don't know how to write inspiring read-me's.  Byte me.

(To Do: Add CF Templates and short descriptions)
